# AeroGear SimplePush Server
__Disclaimer: This is only a proof of concept.__  
This project is a Java implementation of the server side that follows the [SimplePush Protocol](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush/Protocol)

## Usage

### Build the SimplePush Server

    mvn install

### Start the SimplePush Server

    mvn exec:java
    
This will start the server listening to port 7777 and using transport layer security. To toggle these arguments you can
specify overrides on the command lind:  

    mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="8888 false 10000"
    
The first argument is the _port_ to listen to.  
The second argument is whether to use transport layer security or not.  
The last arguement is the how often the UserAgentReaper job will run to clean up inactive user agents.
    
### Access the demo html page


#### Setting up TLS/SSL
This SimplePush Server uses Web Sockets on top transport layer security/secure socket layer and there for requires
a certifcate to be accepted by the client. The serveris already configured which you can see by inspecting the pom.xml, but
the browsers need to import the certificate.  

For some broswers is will be enough to access ```https://localhost:7777``` once, and then accept the certificate.  For other
systems it migth be required to import the certificate through the browser preferens/settings page. For this case we
have exported the cerfificate and it can be found in ```src/test/resources/cert.cer```.

#### Mac WebServer

Serve _src/main/resources/netty/socket.html_ from a local webserver. One way to do this is to create a symbolic link
to _src/main/resources/netty_, for example:

    cd /Library/WebServer/Documents/
    sudo ln -s /path/to/push/aerogear-simplepush-server/src/main/resources/netty/ netty
    
Now you should be able to point your browser to ```http://localhost/netty/websocket.html```
The path to your documents directory and the port that the web server is listening to might differ. For httpd the look
in _/etc/apache2/httpd.conf_ for this information.

#### Python WebServer

In case you are not running a mac, there is a simple HTTP server, that comes with Python. Simple navigate to ```src/main/resources/netty``` and issue:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5555

Now you should be able to point your browser to ```http://localhost:5555/websocket.html```



### Register a channel
You will automatically be registered to receive push notifications for mail and foo. The endpoint channelID's will be displayed in the results textarea.

### Send a notification

Use one of the above mentioned IDs in the following ```curl``` command:

    curl -i --header "Accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -X PUT -d "version=1" "https://localhost:7777/endpoint/{ChannelID}"

A push notification stating the version will be displayed in the textarea of the _websocket.html_ page that has registerd for that channel.

## Protocol

### Hello Handshake
Is sent by the UserAgent to the SimplePush Server:

![Hello Message](https://raw.github.com/danbev/aerogear-simplepush-server/master/server/src/etc/images/hello-message.png)  

The SimplePush Server will ignore any additional Hello Messages after the first one on the web socket connection. 

#### Request format

    {
       "messageType": "hello",
       "uaid": "fd52438f-1c49-41e0-a2e4-98e49833cc9c",
       "channelIDs": ["431b4391-c78f-429a-a134-f890b5adc0bb", "a7695fa0-9623-4890-9c08-cce0231e4b36"]
    } 

__uaid__  
The UserAgent Identifier is optional and if not specified a UAID will be created on by the SimplePush Server. This can 
be used as a way of reseting. The ```channeldIDs``` are also optional and when specified these channels will be registered
during the handshake. This can be useful if the UserAgent has stored the ```uaid``` and for some reason has disconnected, and
then reconnected. By passing both a ```uaid``` and the ```channelIDs``` it can restore the channels that were registered at 
the point when the UserAgent disconnected.

__channelIDs__  
The optional channelIds passed in are identifiers created on the client side and will be associated with the ```UAID```. In the case
of a Hello Message the _channelIDs_ represent channels that the UserAgent want to have registered.


#### Response format

    {
       "messageType": "hello",
       "uaid": "fd52438f-1c49-41e0-a2e4-98e49833cc9c",
    } 


### Register
Register is used to register a ```channelId``` with the SimplePush server and enables the the client to be notified when the version 
for this channel is updated.

![Register Channel](https://raw.github.com/danbev/aerogear-simplepush-server/master/server/src/etc/images/register-channel.png)  
Notice that the ```UAID``` is absent from this message. This is because we have already performed hello message handshake and the current 
web socket connection is for the current UserAgent (identified by the UAID).

#### Request format

    {
      "messageType": "register",
      "channelID": "d9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985cd6cd"
    }  
    
#### Response format

    {
      "messageType": "register",
      "channelID": "d9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985cd6cd",
      "status": 200,
      "pushEndpoint": "/endpoint/d9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985cd6cd"
    }  
    
__status__  

* 200 "OK"   
* 409 "Conflict"
The chosen channelId is already in use and not associated with this user agent. UserAgent should retry with a different
channelId.
* 500 "Internal Server error"
 
### Notification
A notification is triggered by sending a ```PUT``` request to the ```pushEndpoint```.

![Notification](https://raw.github.com/danbev/aerogear-simplepush-server/master/server/src/etc/images/notification.png)  

#### Request PUT format

    PUT http://server/simplepush-server//endpoint/d9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985cd6cd
    ContentType: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    
    version=N
    
#### Response (PUT) format

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    
#### Notification Request format
    
    {
      "messageType": "notification",
      "updates": [{"channelID": "d9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985cd6cd", "version" 2}, {"channeID": "a9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985dd688", "version": 10}]"
    }  
    
#### Notification Response format

    {
      "messageType": "ack",
      "updates": [{"channelID": "d9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985cd6cd", "version" 2}]"
    }  
The ```updates``` are the channels that the UserAgent acknowledges that it has processed.   
The SimplePush server will try to will resend the the un-acknowledged notifications once. This should be a scheduled job 
later if this is turned into more than a proof of concept.

### Unregister

![Unregister](https://raw.github.com/danbev/aerogear-simplepush-server/master/server/src/etc/images/unregister-channel.png)  

#### Request format

    {
      "messageType": "unregister",
      "channelID": "d9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985cd6cd"
    }  
    
#### Response format

    {
      "messageType": "unregister",
      "channelID": "d9b74644-4f97-46aa-b8fa-9393985cd6cd"
      "status": 200
    }
